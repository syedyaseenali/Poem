    <h1>RIVER</h1>
    <p>there is something about the grace of the river <br />
        that keeps me singing & dancing to the alto of her metal clavicles.<br /><br />
        
        the rhythm of her gourd-rattle—the wavelength of her skirt.<br />
        but your uncleanliness is the broken chord altering the symphony<br /><br />
        
        of this orchestra of godliness.<br />
        you who have made the body of water a septic-tank for your toxins.<br /><br />
        
        you who empty your dregs into the belly of the river—<br />
        killing a thousand generations with your filthiness—<br /><br />
        
        maiming the sons & daughters of the water deity. tell me,<br />
        what would you do to protect your own children from harm?<br /><br />
        
        it is raining season again & you are praying to God against flood<br />
        with the excrement of yesteryears still on your palms.<br /><br />
        
        listen to how the water laughs at your foolishness.<br />
        humans who have smeared their own riverscapes with dirt.<br /><br />
        
        & what would you do without water? what would become of a child<br />
        without the amniotic fl uid in her mother’s womb?<br /><br />
        
        this verse is a cowry of admonition—the dialect of Yemọja<br />
        telling you to treat water with dignity. listen: the same reason<br /><br />
        
        you prepare indigo for your off springs<br />
        makes the cattle-egret adorn her own with white garments.</p>
