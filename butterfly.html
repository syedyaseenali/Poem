    <h1>BUTTERFLY</h1>
    <p>My one-and-a-half-year-old daughter <br />
        Leaves holding my finger<br />
        And runs away to catch a butterfly<br />
        Fluttering in the yard –<br />
        The butterfly keeps on flying around<br />
        And she keeps on following it.<br /><br />
        
        The butterfly flies away from the view<br />
        And then she starts crying;<br />
        I hold my daughter to my bosom,<br />
        Caress her, try to soothe her.<br />
        I feel like saying – ‘Don’t cry, chhori*!<br />
        The butterfly is not our living;<br />
        It’s only a deception like a dream’.<br /><br />
        
        I too have arrived in this city<br />
        Leaving my home and village,<br />
        My father and mother –<br />
        Following and chasing my dream.<br />
        And my dream has further eluded me –<br />
        It has run away from me.<br />
        But like my daughter<br />
        I cannot cry<br />
        Even though I want to</p>
